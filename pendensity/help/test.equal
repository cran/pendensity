_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Every group of factor combination is tested pairwise for equality
     to all other groups.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     test.equal(obj)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     obj: object of class pendensity

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     We consider the distribution of the integrated B-Spline density
     base. This is saved in the program in the object named 'mat1'.
     Moreover, we use the variance 'var.par' of the estimation, the
     weights and some matrices 'C' of the two compared densities to
     construct the matrix 'W'. We simulate the distribution of the test
     statistic using a spectral decomposition of W.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Returning a list of p-values for testing pairwise for equality.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

     Christian Schellhase <cschellhase@wiwi.uni-bielefeld>

_R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s:

     Penalized Density Estimation, Kauermann G. and Schellhase C.
     (2009), to appear.
