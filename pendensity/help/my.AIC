_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Calculating the AIC vaule of the density estimation. Therefore, we
     add the unpenalized log likelihood of the estimation and the
     degree of freedom, which are

_U_s_a_g_e:

     my.AIC(penden.env, lambda0, opt.Likelihood = NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

penden.env: Containing all information, environment of pendensity()

 lambda0: penalty parameter lambda

opt.Likelihood: optimal unpenalized likelihood of the density
          estimation

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     AIC is calculated as AIC(lambda)= - l(hat{beta}) + df(lambda)

_V_a_l_u_e:

   myAIC: sum of the negative unpenalized log likelihood and mytrace

 mytrace: calculated mytrace as the sum of the diagonal matrix df,
          which results as the product of the invers of the penalized
          second order derivative of the log likelihood with the
          unpenalized second order derivative of the log likelihood
