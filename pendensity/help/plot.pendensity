_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Plotting estimated penalized densities, need object of class
     'pendensity'.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## S3 method for class 'pendensity':
     plot(x, plot.val = 1, latt = FALSE, kernel = FALSE, confi = TRUE,
      main = NULL, sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, plot.base = FALSE,
      lwd=NULL,legend.txt=NULL,...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: object of class pendensity

plot.val: if plot.val=1 the density is plotted, if plot.val=2 the
          distribution on the observation values is plotted, if
          plot.val=3 the distribution is plotted as function

    latt: TRUE/FALSE if the lattice interface should be used for
          ploting, default=FALSE

  kernel: TRUE/FALSE if a kernel density estimation should be added to
          the density plots, default=FALSE

   confi: TRUE/FALSE if confidence intervals should be added to the
          density plots, default=TRUE 

    main: Main of the density plot, if NULL main contains settings 'K',
          'AIC' and 'lambda0' of the estimation

     sub: sub of the density plot, if NULL sub contains settings used
          base 'base' and used order of B-Spline 'q'

    xlab: xlab of the density plot, if NULL xlab contains 'y'

    ylab: ylab of the density plot, if NULL ylab contains 'density'

plot.base: TRUE/FALSE if the weighted base should be added to the
          density plot, default=FALSE

     lwd: lwd of the lines of density plot, if NULL lwd=3, the
          confidence bands are plotted with lwd=2

legend.txt: if FALSE no legend is plotted, legend.txt can get a vector
          of chracters with length of the groupings. legend.txt works
          only for plot.val=1

     ...: further arguments

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Each grouping of factors is plotted. Therefore, equidistant help
     values are constructed in the support of the response for each
     grouping of factors. Weighting these help values with knots
     weights ck results in the density estimation for each grouping of
     factors. If asked for, pointwise confidence intervals are computed
     and plotted.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     If the density function is ploted, function returns two values 

help.env: Contains the constructed help values for the response, the
          corresponding values for the densities and if asked for the
          calculated confidence intervals

   combi: list of all combinations of the covariates

       y: containing the observed values y

     sum: containing the empirical distribution of each observation y

     If the theoretical distribution function is plotted, the function
     returns an environment. For plotting the theoretical
     distributions, each interval between two knots is evaluated at 100
     equidistant simulated points between the two knots considered.
     These points are saved in the environment with the name
     "paste("x",i,sep="")" for each interval i, the calculated
     distribution is save with the name "paste("F(x)",i,sep="")" for
     each interval i. For these points, the distribution is calculated.

_N_o_t_e:

     For plotting the density and e.g. the empirical distributions, use
     e.g. 'X11()' before calling the second plot to open a new graphic
     device.

_R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s:

     Penalized Density Estimation, Kauermann G. and Schellhase C.
     (2009), to appear.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     y <- rnorm(100)
     test <- pendensity(y~1)
     plot(test)

     #empirical distribution
     plot(test,plot.val=2)
