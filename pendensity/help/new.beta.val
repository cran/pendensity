_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     We terminate the search for the new beta, when the new log
     likelihood is smaller than the old likelihood and the step size is
     smaller or equal 1e-3. We calculate the direction of the Newton
     Raphson step for the known beta_t and iterate a step size
     bisection to control the maximizing of the penalized likelihood 

                           l(beta,lambda0)

     . This means we set 

 beta[t+1]=beta[t]-(2/v)*sp(beta,lambda0)*(-Jp(beta[t],lambda0))^-1

     with s_p as penalized first order derivative and J_p as penalized
     second order derivative. We begin with v=0. Not yielding a new
     maximum for a current v, we increase v step by step respectively
     bisect the step size. We terminate the iteration, if the step size
     is smaller than some reference value epsilon (eps=1e-3) without
     yielding a new maximum. We iterate for new parameter beta until
     the new log likelihood depending on the new estimated parameter
     beta differ less than 0.1 log-likelihood points from the log
     likelihood estimated before.
